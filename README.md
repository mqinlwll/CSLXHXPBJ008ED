# Music DashBoard

Demo: https://mqinlwll.github.io/7US8Q6W14DB8FGO02ZVLKU0BX754N1M13LK9L7TU30033A/

## Being able:
- Update not being overwrite or duplicate.
- Show track info include:
	1. Title
	2. Albums
	3. Artist
	4. Sample Rate
	5. Bitrate
	6. Bitdepth
	7. Channel
	8. File Size (in MB)
	9. Durations
## Few note:
- It will not generate well with the Various Artist (or compilation album).
- Ignore the templates/various_artist.html, is just mine experiment being failed (for now).
- Recommend for local use than the github link as demo (some problem with github being link i don't know...)
